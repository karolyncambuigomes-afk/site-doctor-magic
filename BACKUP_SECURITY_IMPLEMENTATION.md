# Comprehensive Backup and Security Hardening Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of backup automation, security hardening, and admin authentication enhancements for the Five London platform.

## üîí Security Hardening Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Security Headers
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**: 1-year max-age with includeSubDomains and preload
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict policy with specific allowlists for Supabase and Vercel
- **Admin-specific security**: Enhanced CSP for admin routes with frame-ancestors 'none'
- **Secure cookie flags**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict
- **Additional headers**: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy

### 2. Admin Route Protection
```apache
<LocationMatch "^/admin">
    Header always set X-Frame-Options "DENY"
    Header always set Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private"
    Header always set Content-Security-Policy "frame-ancestors 'none'"
</LocationMatch>
```

### 3. Two-Factor Authentication System
- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)** support
- **Backup codes** for account recovery
- **Database tables**: `admin_two_factor` with encrypted secrets
- **User interface**: Complete 2FA setup and management

### 4. Rate Limiting and Session Management
- **Login attempt tracking**: IP-based rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- **Session management**: Active session tracking with timeout
- **Database functions**: `check_admin_rate_limit()` with automatic cleanup

## üóÑÔ∏è Backup System Implementation

### 1. Automated Backup Script (`scripts/backup.sh`)
```bash
# Key features:
- Database schema, data, and roles backup
- Code repository bundling with git
- Storage backup instructions (manual process)
- GPG encryption with AES256
- SHA256 checksums for integrity
- Comprehensive manifest generation
```

### 2. Restore Script (`scripts/restore.sh`)
```bash
# Key features:
- Encrypted backup decryption and validation
- Database restoration with safety checks
- Code repository restoration
- Environment-specific deployment (staging/production)
- Comprehensive verification checklist
```

### 3. Backup Schedule Recommendation
```bash
# Cron job for daily backups
0 2 * * * /path/to/scripts/backup.sh

# Weekly verification
0 3 * * 0 /path/to/scripts/verify-backup.sh
```

## üîç Audit Logging System

### 1. Database Schema
- **admin_login_attempts**: Track all login attempts with IP, user agent, 2FA usage
- **admin_sessions**: Active session management with timeout
- **admin_audit_log**: Comprehensive action logging with risk levels
- **admin_rate_limits**: IP-based rate limiting with automatic cleanup

### 2. Audit Functions
```sql
-- Log admin actions with risk assessment
log_admin_action(action_type, resource_type, resource_id, old_values, new_values, risk_level)

-- Rate limiting check
check_admin_rate_limit(identifier_value) RETURNS JSONB

-- Automatic cleanup
cleanup_admin_security_data()
```

### 3. Admin Security Manager Component
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Active session management
- Login attempt analysis
- Audit log viewing with risk level filtering
- Two-factor authentication setup

## üõ°Ô∏è Admin Authentication Enhancements

### 1. Multi-layer Security
- **Rate limiting**: 5 failed attempts = 30-minute lockout
- **Session timeout**: Configurable session expiration
- **IP tracking**: Monitor login attempts by IP address
- **2FA requirement**: Optional but recommended for all admin accounts

### 2. Security Monitoring
- **Real-time alerts**: Failed login attempts, suspicious activities
- **Risk assessment**: Low, medium, high, critical risk levels
- **Session monitoring**: Active session tracking and termination
- **Audit trail**: Complete action history with timestamps

### 3. Admin Security Dashboard Features
- Overview with key security metrics
- Active session management with termination capability
- Login attempt history with success/failure analysis
- Comprehensive audit logs with filtering
- Two-factor authentication setup and management

## üöÄ CDN and Cache Configuration

### 1. Security-focused Caching
- **Admin pages**: Never cached (no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate)
- **Auth pages**: Never cached with additional security headers
- **Static assets**: 1-year cache with immutable flags
- **API endpoints**: Bypass cache entirely

### 2. Cache Invalidation Strategy
- **Automated invalidation**: On every deployment
- **Selective invalidation**: Only changed assets
- **Multi-CDN support**: Cloudflare and AWS CloudFront
- **Verification scripts**: Test cache configuration

## üìä Monitoring and Alerts

### 1. Security Metrics
- Active admin sessions count
- Failed login attempts (24h window)
- 2FA adoption rate
- High-risk audit events

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Cache hit rates (target: 85%+)
- Page load times from multiple locations
- CDN performance metrics
- Security header validation

## üîß Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions Required
- [ ] Enable 2FA for all admin accounts
- [ ] Configure backup schedule (daily at 2 AM)
- [ ] Set up CDN with security rules
- [ ] Test backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Verify HSTS headers are active
