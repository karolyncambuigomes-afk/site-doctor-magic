        <li><strong>Multiple Rooms:</strong> Suites with separate living areas offer more space for entertaining</li>
        <li><strong>Private Terraces:</strong> When available, these provide secluded outdoor space</li>
        <li><strong>Butler Service:</strong> Ensures discreet handling of all requests</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Restaurant Reservations</h4>
      <p>The hotel concierge can secure reservations at London's most exclusive restaurants, often with preferred seating in more private areas. Many Mayfair restaurants offer private dining rooms perfect for intimate dinners.</p>

      <h4>Bar Experiences</h4>
      <p>Each hotel features exceptional bars perfect for pre-dinner cocktails or late-night champagne. Claridge's Bar, The Connaught Bar, and The Dorchester Bar are among London's finest, offering both sophistication and discretion.</p>

      <h3>Dress Code and Etiquette</h3>
      
      <h4>Hotel Public Areas</h4>
      <p>Mayfair hotels maintain elegant dress codes in public spaces, particularly restaurants and bars. Smart casual is the minimum, with many guests choosing business attire or evening wear. Jeans, trainers, and casual sportswear are generally not appropriate in restaurants and bars.</p>

      <h4>Suite Attire</h4>
      <p>Within your suite, comfort is paramount. Hotels provide luxury robes and slippers for relaxation. For in-suite dining, dress as formally or casually as you prefer.</p>

      <h3>Transportation and Arrival</h3>
      
      <h4>Discreet Arrivals</h4>
      <p>All five hotels can arrange private car service from airports or stations. Many have discrete side entrances that can be used for arrivals and departures, bypassing main lobby areas.</p>

      <h4>In-Mayfair Transport</h4>
      <p>Mayfair's compact size makes it ideal for walking between attractions. However, hotels can provide chauffeur service for longer journeys or when discretion is paramount. Private car hire ensures complete privacy during transport.</p>

      <h3>Seasonal Considerations</h3>
      
      <h4>Peak Seasons</h4>
      <p>Book well in advance for peak seasons (June-August, December). Major London events like Royal Ascot, Wimbledon, and London Fashion Week drive significant demand for Mayfair's finest hotels.</p>

      <h4>Off-Peak Advantages</h4>
      <p>November, January, and February often offer better rates while maintaining the same exceptional service. These periods can provide better suite availability and more personalized attention.</p>

      <h3>Additional Services and Amenities</h3>
      
      <ul>
